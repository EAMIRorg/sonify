# sonify
Sonify is a system for converting abstract data points into music by plotting the data to a musical scale and then describing what's going on in the data to further refine the composition.

This source requires Max 8 or greater (available from http://cycling74.com) and relies on the EAMIR SDK (available from http://eamir.org or the Max package manager).

Sample data has been included in "_sample data" folder.
