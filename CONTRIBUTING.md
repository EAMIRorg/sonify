# Contributing to Sonify

This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the this project. We welcome contributions from everyone, whether it's code, documentation, or feedback. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.

Our CLA allows this project to remain open source while also offering commercial licenses. Contributors retain ownership of their contributions, and their work will continue to be available under the project’s open-source license.

If you submit work that you do not fully own (for example, code written as part of your employment), you must ensure you have the legal right to submit it and that any required approvals have been obtained.


# Why we use a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Squidbox is released as open-source software, and we welcome community contributions of all kinds. To keep the project healthy and sustainable over time, we ask contributors to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

WHAT THE CLA DOES

The CLA ensures that:

You keep ownership of your contributions.
Signing the CLA does not transfer copyright to us.

We have the legal right to include your contribution in the project.
This allows us to distribute Sonify under its open-source license and to maintain the project without legal ambiguity.

We can offer both open-source and commercial licenses.
Sonify is available under the AGPLv3, and we may also offer commercial licenses to developers who need to build proprietary applications. The CLA makes this possible while keeping the open-source version available to everyone.

WHAT THE CLA DOES NOT DO

It does not affect music, audio, or other creative works you create using Sonify.
Anything you compose, record, or produce with the software is entirely yours.

It does not restrict your ability to fork, modify, or use Sonify under its open-source license.

It does not require paper forms or manual signatures.
The CLA is accepted electronically via GitHub when you submit a pull request.

WHY THIS MATTERS

Without a CLA, contributions from multiple authors can make it difficult or impossible to evolve the project’s licensing over time, offer commercial licenses when appropriate, or protect contributors and maintainers from unintended legal risk.

The CLA helps us keep Sonify open, usable, and sustainable for the long term — for researchers, musicians, developers, and commercial users alike.

If you have questions about the CLA or how it applies to a specific contribution, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion before submitting a pull request.
